These are the configuration files and some movies from my [MPhys thesis project](https://github.com/JBorrow/MPhysThesis).

Please note that there may be some offsets (e.g. some show Q=0.2 instead of Q=0.7) in the values for the movies; this is due to them being created at a time when the visualisation code was buggy. You should still be able to get a good picture of what is going on in the simulations as well.

Of course, the parameterfiles and initial conditions generation files are provided so that anyone can re-run the simulations with [InterStellarGadget](https://github.com/JBorrow/InterStellarGadget).
